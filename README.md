# GolfScoreImport_TN

DEV NOTES:
We need to re-implement the "overview" screen that allows us to view the total scores for each player during the game. This screen will let us compare the scores of each player to see who's winning at any moment, and also easily go back and edit the score for individual holes.
Prof likes our overall workflow, and we should definitely keep to the idea of a streamlined process with minimal user interaction.
We need tp "pretty up" our app. Prof wants to see pleasing colors and a clean layout.
